# AI SaaS Web App - Personal Project

Welcome to my AI-powered SaaS web app! This project is a personal endeavor, built purely out of passion for technology and a desire to explore the capabilities of modern web development and artificial intelligence.

## Overview

This project is a fully functional SaaS (Software as a Service) web application built using **Next.js**, a powerful React framework for server-rendered applications. The app leverages AI to provide four distinct functionalities:

1. **Chatbot**: A conversational AI model that can engage in meaningful and context-aware conversations with users.
2. **Code Generation**: An AI model that assists in generating code snippets, boilerplate code, or even complete functions based on user input.
3. **Image Generation**: A creative AI model that generates images from textual descriptions, enabling users to create visual content effortlessly.
4. **Music Generation**: An AI model that composes music or generates audio clips based on user input.

The app is deployed and accessible online, showcasing my ability to build, deploy, and maintain a modern web application with multiple AI-driven features.

## Key Features

- **AI Integration**: The app integrates with **Gemini API** for chatbot and code generation, **Pollinations AI** for image generation, and **Beatoven API** for music generation, delivering intelligent and dynamic functionality across multiple domains.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication implemented using **Clerk**, providing a smooth and reliable login experience.
- **Database**: Utilizes **Prisma** with **MongoDB** as the database provider for storing user data and app-related information.
- **Payment Integration**: Integrated **Stripe** for handling premium membership payments, enabling secure and seamless transactions.
- **Customer Support**: Integrated **Crisp** for real-time customer chat support, ensuring users can get help whenever needed.
- **Deployment**: Deployed on **Vercel** with CI/CD pipelines for automated updates and seamless deployment.
